## :kr: Data Engineer

I am a data engineer who believes there is no end to learning and is constantly seeking the right direction.
I think the right decisions come from collaboration and sharing.

I am good at simple Python functional programming and automate everything from business to routine everyday life through the cloud.

And I mainly solve problems with coding that fits the given infrastructure situation, and I always think about a better process with less dependence.

I place the most important value in data as integrity, and I value pre-processing to deliver valuable data.
